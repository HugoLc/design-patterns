- When you need to simplify
  and unify a large interface or
  complex set of interfaces, use
  a facade.
- A facade decouples a client
  from a complex subsystem.
- Implementing a facade
  requires that we compose
  the facade with its subsystem
  and use delegation to
  perform the work of the
  facade.
- You can implement more than
  one facade for a subsystem.
- An adapter wraps an object
  to change its interface, a
  decorator wraps an object
  to add new behaviors and
  responsibilities, and a facade
  “wraps” a set of objects to
  simplify
