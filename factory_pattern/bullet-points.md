- Factory Method = creates objects through inheritance
- Abstract Method = creates objects through composition
- Factory Method = Defines an
  interface for creating an object, but
  let subclasses decide which class to
  instantiate. Factory Method lets
  a class defer instantiation to the
  subclasses.
- Abstract Method = Provides
  an interface for creating families of
  related or dependent objects without
  specifying their concrete classes
- All factories encapsulate object
  creation.
- Simple Factory, while not a
  bona fide design pattern, is a
  simple way to decouple your
  clients from concrete classes.
- Factory Method relies on
  inheritance: object creation is
  delegated to subclasses, which
  implement the factory method
  to create objects.
- Abstract Factory relies on
  object composition: object
  creation is implemented in
  methods exposed in the factory
  interface.
- All factory patterns promote
  loose coupling by reducing the
  dependency of your application
  on concrete classes.
- The intent of Factory Method
  is to allow a class to defer
  instantiation to its subclasses.
- The intent of Abstract Factory
  is to create families of related
  objects without having to
  depend on their concrete
  classes.
- The Dependency Inversion
  Principle guides us to avoid
  dependencies on concrete
  types and to strive for
  abstractions.
- Factories are a powerful
  technique for coding to
  abstractions, not concrete
  classes.
