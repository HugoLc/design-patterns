- The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface
  for creating families of related or dependent objects
  without specifying their concrete classes.
- Weâ€™ve certainly seen that Abstract Factory allows a client to use an abstract interface to
  create a set of related products without knowing (or caring) about the concrete products that
  are actually produced. In this way, the client is decoupled from any of the specifics of the
  concrete products.
