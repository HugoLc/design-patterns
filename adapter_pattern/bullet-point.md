-When you need to use
an existing class and its
interface is not the one you
need, use an adapter.

- An adapter changes an
  interface into one a client
  expects.
- Implementing an adapter may
  require little work or a great
  deal of work depending on
  the size and complexity of the
  target interface.
- There are two forms of the
  Adapter Pattern: object
  and class adapters. Class
  adapters require multiple
  inheritance.
- An adapter wraps an object
  to change its interface, a
  decorator wraps an object
  to add new behaviors and
  responsibilities, and a facade
  “wraps” a set of objects to
  simplify
