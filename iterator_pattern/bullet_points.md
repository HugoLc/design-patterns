- An Iterator allows access to an
  aggregate’s elements without
  exposing its internal structure.
- An Iterator takes the job of
  iterating over an aggregate
  and encapsulates it in another
  object.
- When using an Iterator, we
  relieve the aggregate of the
  responsibility of supporting
  operations for traversing its
  data.
- An Iterator provides a
  common interface for
  traversing the items of an
  aggregate, allowing you to use
  polymorphism when writing
  code that makes use of the
  items of the aggregate.
- The Iterable interface provides
  a means of getting an
  iterator and enables Java’s
  enchanced for loop.
- We should strive to assign
  only one responsibility to each
  class.
