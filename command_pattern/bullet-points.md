- The Command Pattern
  decouples an object making
  a request from the one that
  knows how to perform it.
- A Command object is at the
  center of this decoupling and
  encapsulates a receiver with
  an action (or set of actions).
- An invoker makes a request
  of a Command object by
  calling its execute() method,
  which invokes those actions
  on the receiver.
- Invokers can be
  parameterized with
  Commands, even
  dynamically at runtime.
- Commands may support
  undo by implementing an
  undo() method that restores
  the object to its previous
  state before the execute()
  method was last called.
- MacroCommands are a
  simple extension of the
  Command Pattern that
  allow multiple commands
  to be invoked. Likewise,
  MacroCommands can easily
  support undo().
- In practice, it’s not
  uncommon for “smart”
  Command objects to
  implement the request
  themselves rather than
  delegating to a receiver.
- Commands may also be
  used to implement logging
  and transactional systems.
